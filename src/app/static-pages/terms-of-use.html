                to the Service through your Digital Devices or your account. Therefore, you must take steps to ensure that others
                do not gain unauthorized access to the Service through any</p>
              <p>means, including without limitation, wireless networking and wired networking. The Service may not be used to breach
                the security of another user or to attempt to gain access to any other person’s equipment, software or data,
                without the knowledge and consent of that person. Additionally, the Service may not be used in any attempt to
                circumvent the user authentication or security of any host, network, or account, including without limitation,
                accessing data not intended for you, logging into or making use of a server or account you are not expressly
                authorized to access, or probing the security of other networks. Use or distribution of tools designed for compromising
                security, such as password guessing programs, cracking tools, packet sniffers or network probing tools, is prohibited.
                You may not disrupt the Service. The Service also may not be used to interfere with computer networking or telecommunications
                services to any user, host or network, including without limitation, denial of service attacks, flooding of a
                network, overloading a service, improper seizing and abuse of operator privileges and attempts to &quot;crash&quot;
                a host. The transmission or dissemination of any information or software that contains a virus or other harmful
                feature is also prohibited. You are solely responsible for the security of any Digital Device you choose to connect
                to the Service, including any data stored on that device. You may not access the Service using a “rooted” or
                “jailbroken” device. In particular,
                <b>Ignite </b>recommends against enabling file or printer sharing of any sort.
                <b>Ignite </b>recommends that any files or services you do choose to make available for remote access be protected
                with a strong password or as otherwise appropriate.</p>

                explicitly requested it. The Service may not be used to send messages to any individual who has indicated that
                he/she does not wish to receive messages from you. The Service may not be used to collect responses from unsolicited
                email messages sent from accounts on other Internet hosts or email services that violate this AUP or the acceptable

              <p>Moreover, unsolicited email messages may not direct the recipient to any web site or other resource that uses the
                Service. Forging, altering or removing email headers is prohibited. You may not reference the
                <b>Ignite</b>
              </p>
              <p>network (for example, by including “Organization:
                <b>Ignite</b>” in the header or by listing an IP address that belongs to
                <b>Ignite</b>) in any unsolicited email even if that email is not sent through the
                <b>Ignite </b>network. “
                <b>Mail bombing</b>” is prohibited. That is, you may not send numerous copies of the same or substantially similar
                messages, nor may you send very large messages or files to a recipient with the intent to disrupt a server or
                account. The propagation of chain letters is similarly prohibited, whether or not the recipient wishes to receive
                such mailings.
                <b>Ignite </b>is not responsible for the forwarding of email sent to any account that has been suspended or terminated.
                Such email will be returned to sender, ignored, deleted, or stored temporarily, at
